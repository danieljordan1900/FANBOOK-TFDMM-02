Despite her ordinary appearance, Magi is a pony with extraordinary skills in various fields such as administration, computing, economics, and human resources. However, her ability to manage multiple tasks at once is quite limited, leading her to delegate part of her work to other trusted ponies. Of course, the only pony she fully trusts is her girlfriend, whom she has overloaded with work on several occasions. Fortunately, this hasn't caused any issues in their relationship, as her girlfriend, Dulce, enjoys both the workload and being with her.

The last heir of the noble unicorn house StarHeart, Badwhiz was born approximately a hundred years before Nightmare Moon's return to Equestria. He spent most of his childhood in the grand family mansion in SilverHollow, alongside his siblings and cousins. Unfortunately, his relationship with them was always distant, even before the patriarch of the family passed away.

Currently, he holds a monetary inheritance registered in the master ledger of the Canterlot Central Bank, though it is practically inaccessible as it requires the presence of another living official relative to make a withdrawal, which he no longer has.
