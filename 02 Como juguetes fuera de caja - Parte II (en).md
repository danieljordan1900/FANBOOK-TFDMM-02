Amidst a lush celestial forest, the last and tragic battle of that war began...

"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" Rainbow Dash screamed, lunging at her opponent. Filled with all the fury she could muster, she flew toward Badwhiz at full speed and, with a single kick, sent the sealing crystal embedded in his left helmet flying far away. Then, with another strike, she aimed a kick straight at his head.

It wasn’t enough. Badwhiz’s magical shield activated at the last moment, deflecting the blow that would have knocked him unconscious.

The counterattack began.

Badwhiz fired a beam as thick as a tree trunk, barely missing Rainbow Dash.

The pegasus, though her speed was diminished by exhaustion, refused to back down and continued attacking Badwhiz’s barrier from different angles.

Badwhiz kept hurling thunderbolts, explosions shaking the battlefield.

One after another, conflagrations erupted. There were no words between them, no pauses in their movements...

The merciless battle soon became a test of endurance.

Giving it her all, Rainbow Dash felt her body failing. Every muscle fiber screamed at her to stop, but she refused. She could hear her bones rattling and see her wings twisting midair, forcing her off course.

But she didn’t stop—she couldn’t.

Fluttershy, Applejack, Twilight... all of them.

None of her friends were there.

They had all vanished... and it was all his fault.

"I’ll avenge them! I’ll avenge every last one!"

She screamed at herself, ignoring the pain, the exhaustion—everything.

Tears mixed with sweat as she charged at Badwhiz again and again. Counterattacks came and missed, over and over. She didn’t care about the frustration on her enemy’s face or the agony in her own body. She just wanted to see him fall—once and for all.

One hit. One final, decisive strike.

That was all she needed.

And finally, it came.

"Ughhhhhhhhhhhh..."

Rainbow Dash crashed to the ground after a powerful clash. Badwhiz, on the other side, was violently thrown back into his magic barrier. For the first time in the fight, there was no immediate retaliation.

The pink-maned earth pony struggled to open his mouth, gasping for breath. The pegasus managed a weak smile.

This was her moment.

She couldn’t feel her wings. She couldn’t even spread them. But it didn’t matter. She only needed her legs.

With unbearable effort, Rainbow Dash forced herself up, ignoring the searing pain in her body. She focused what little energy she had left into her limbs and pushed forward, accelerating with each step.

She could hear the thunderous exhaustion roaring inside her, but it didn’t stop her.

Her opponent, still dazed, noticed her approach and stared at her with wide eyes.

"Just a little more! Haaaaa!"

With one last battle cry, Rainbow Dash leaped and spun midair—a move that should’ve been impossible in her state, but she pulled it off. With both hind legs together, she struck Badwhiz’s barrier head-on.

The impact echoed through the entire forest.

Badwhiz, unable to react in time, was sent flying and crashed to the ground with a thunderous boom.

His magic barrier finally shattered.

He could no longer maintain it.

Rainbow Dash, swaying unsteadily, watched with dark satisfaction as her opponent tried to crawl away.

Victory was within her grasp.

"Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!"

Voices echoed around her, sharpening in her mind like a deafening roar. She saw herself surrounded by a cheering crowd.

She no longer thought of her friends, or even her own life. Only one thing remained in her mind: vengeance.

Consumed by her own fury, she advanced without hesitation. But then, another voice cut through.

"Rainbow Dash! No! Don’t keep fighting—it’s enough! Stop!"

A distant echo... like Twilight’s voice...

But she ignored it.

There was no stopping now. Final victory was just a few steps away...

"Rainbow Dash!"

Another voice pierced her mind, and this time, she froze.

"Applejack?!"

Her name escaped her lips in a whisper.

But the shock lasted only an instant.

A blinding light erupted before her.

The gem on Badwhiz’s neck had finally reached its limit.

Horrified, Rainbow Dash squinted, shielding her face with her battered wings as the overloaded gem emitted a searing radiance.

A fatal mistake.

Before she could realize her error, a massive black bolt struck her head-on.

Everything turned weightless.

The world spun uncontrollably.

Her vision, blurred by the violent motion, came to an abrupt halt as her body slammed into the jagged, rocky ground.

In that final moment, in the brief time she had left, her shock-addled mind could only cling to one memory.

The last voice she had heard...

"Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!"

Applejack had called out to her in desperation.

The remnants of her consciousness faded into a terrifying darkness that swallowed everything.

"Applejack..."

She tried to say her name one last time, but the word died on her lips.

And so, she vanished from that world...

[---]

Much later... in the present...

[---]

"Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!"

In the middle of a cluttered room, Applejack held Rainbow Dash tightly, shaking her in a desperate attempt to wake her up.

"Rainbow Dash! Wake up!" she kept calling, but got no response. Her friend lay unconscious, her face bandaged, showing no signs of life. Every now and then, her one visible eye would flutter open, and she’d let out incoherent murmurs as her mouth twisted into a strange grimace.

The scene dragged on until, suddenly, that single visible eye snapped wide open.

"Rainbow Dash, you’re finally awake, thank Celest— Ughhh!" Applejack barely had time to feel relief before an unexpected kick slammed into her stomach, sending her crashing onto her back.

Rainbow Dash, who had just kicked her, was now standing—awake… or rather, trapped in a violent sleepwalking state. Driven by uncontrollable euphoria, the pegasus kept looking around wildly, like a cornered animal. Without a word, she began biting at the bandages on her body and flapping her wings desperately, like a hummingbird caught in a suffocating web.

Applejack, struggling to her feet, watched in dismay as her friend darted in every direction, crashing into furniture and walls, injuring herself in the process and colliding with their other friends, who were also starting to wake up.

"Rainbow Dash, no! Wait! Stop, Rainbow!" she shouted—but her words went unheard.

Rainbow Dash was completely out of control, and Applejack, the only one free to move at that moment, was also the only one who could do anything about it.

She had to stop her.

With that urgent mission in mind, the farm pony scanned the room for something that could help. Immediately, her eyes locked onto the long bandage still dangling from Rainbow Dash’s neck.

Without a second thought, she sprinted after the pegasus’s trail, leaped into the air, and clamped her teeth onto the end of the bandage, yanking it back with all her strength.

It was an effective move—but brutally abrupt. Anypony else would’ve been seriously hurt, but Rainbow Dash only let out a choked gasp.

Yanked to the ground, her flight was cut short, ending in a thunderous crash against a bookshelf.

Applejack rushed to her fallen friend. She knew Rainbow Dash was tough, but right now, all she cared about was whether she was okay.

"Rainbow Dash, please, snap out of it!" she begged, gripping her shoulders, trying to calm her.

But there was no response. Rainbow Dash, stubborn in her frenzy, tried to take off again, limbs flailing wildly. Applejack, terrified by her friend’s state, felt fear flood her heart. She didn’t understand what was happening—couldn’t accept the madness that had taken hold of her.

"Rainbow Dash, please, come back to us!" Applejack sobbed, hugging her tightly. But the gesture was in vain, met only with more struggling.

With her heart in her throat and hope fading, Applejack, unsure what else to do, helplessly watched the pegasus’s distorted expression.

Then, she noticed something she’d overlooked.

Rainbow Dash’s eyes—now visible as the bandages had come loose—were in a strange position: each looking in a different direction, giving off an unsettling yet familiar vibe.

Didn’t she know somepony in Ponyville with a gaze like that?

Suddenly, an old memory flashed in her mind—and with it, an idea that lit up her face.

Now she knew what to do.

"If it worked before… it can’t fail now, right?" Applejack thought. "Hang on, Rainbow!"

Lifting her hoof, she delivered a sharp, well-aimed THWACK to Rainbow Dash’s head.

The rainbow pegasus took the hit full force—but didn’t collapse. Instead, she stood rigid, trembling like an old machine rebooting after years of inactivity.

Applejack watched anxiously.

Then, Rainbow Dash began moving again—but this time, with more control. Her expression shifted. Her eyes, which had been rolling wildly, slowly refocused.

Her wings, which hadn’t stopped flapping, finally stilled and folded gently. Her limbs, twitching erratically, stretched one last time before relaxing.

Rainbow Dash, her usual demeanor returning, sat down, took a deep breath, and closed her eyes—as if slipping back into the sleep she’d just escaped.

Applejack, stunned by what she’d just witnessed, tilted her head in confusion. She stood frozen, waiting, wondering if something else would happen. After a moment of silence, she cautiously stepped closer.

"…Rainbow Dash?" she asked, her voice trembling.

The response was immediate.

"Ow, Applejack! What in Equestria is wrong with you?!" the pegasus protested, rubbing the fresh bump now decorating her forehead. The distressing scene from moments ago faded as if it had never happened.

A grin spread across Applejack’s face. Then, unable to hold it in, she burst into laughter.

"Hahaha! HAHAHA!"

Her laughter echoed through the room, unrestrained, overflowing. Overcome with pure joy, she didn’t hesitate—she leaped onto her friend and hugged her with all her might.

"Hey, hey, Applejack! What’re you—oof! Too tight! Wait—are you crying?!"

Rainbow Dash blinked, baffled. To her, she’d just woken up from some wild dream, her memory still foggy.

"Ya big, hard-headed—HAHA! I can’t believe it! You’re safe! We’re all safe! YEEHAW!" Applejack whooped, squeezing even tighter.

"We’re… safe? That’s good, right?" Rainbow Dash replied awkwardly, growing more confused by Applejack’s bizarre behavior.

"Yeah! That’s real good!"

"Cool… and uh… where exactly are we safe?" the pegasus asked, scanning the room.

Applejack opened her mouth—but no easy answer came. Her joy faded instantly. She pulled back slightly, her expression darkening as she remembered the unsettling situation they were in.

"I… ain’t sure. Maybe… Twilight’s house?"

Rainbow Dash went silent, not quite understanding. But as she took in the chaotic mess around them, the absurd claim started making sense.

"Okay… so we’re in Twilight’s old house?"

"Eeyup," Applejack confirmed, glancing around again.

"You mean, the Ponyville library? Golden Oak?"

"Eeyup."

"The same one Tirek blew to smithereens?"

"Eeyup…" Applejack repeated, her tone heavier this time, her eyes darting nervously. After a pause, she added, "I don’t get it."

"Agreed… this is weird. Really weird…" Rainbow Dash muttered, eyeing their surroundings with deep suspicion. Then she asked, "What about the others…?"

"They’re here too, safe inside—" Applejack cut herself off as she looked further into the room.

Her sudden silence was understandable. Amid the wreckage from Rainbow Dash’s earlier rampage, Twilight’s house was in even greater chaos than before. Their friends, tangled in the mess, were scattered across the room in absurd situations:

Pinkie Pie, wrapped in her own bandages, dangled from the ceiling like a piñata.

Rarity, trapped under a toppled bookshelf (but luckily cushioned by a pile of pillows), flailed dramatically, trying to free herself.

And in the corner, surrounded by embedded knives, broken bottles, and a small fire, Fluttershy slept peacefully in her bed—completely unharmed, her face angelic, utterly unaware of the madness around her.

Unable to process the scene, Applejack and Rainbow Dash stared in silence as Fluttershy began to stir.

The pink-maned pegasus stretched, let out an adorable yawn, and slowly opened her eyes—still wrapped in serene calm. Noticing her friends’ grave expressions, she blinked a few times, tilted her head slightly, and finally asked in her softest voice:

"Did… something bad happen?"

[---]

Shrouded in a dense night, a scream erupted from inside Twilight’s treehouse.

"Aaaaaahhh!"

"Stop screamin’ so loud, Pinkie! Yer not helpin’!" Applejack snapped, annoyed. Beside her, Rainbow Dash wore an equally frustrated expression. The two carefully maneuvered through the cluttered room, carrying the partially bandaged and plastered body of their pink friend on their backs.

"I’m sorry..." Pinkie Pie tried to apologize—only to let out another short scream.

Applejack rolled her eyes and sighed.

Just moments earlier, she and Rainbow Dash had set out to help their trapped friends. By then, it was clear that Fluttershy was completely unharmed—something Applejack was deeply grateful for. However, the same couldn’t be said for Rarity and Pinkie Pie.

Rarity had no major physical injuries, but the lack of oxygen after being trapped under a bookshelf had left her disoriented. Once freed, she could barely form words and struggled to stand. Thankfully, Fluttershy’s quick intervention stabilized her. Now, she was slowly recovering on the couch under the watchful gaze of the pink-maned pegasus.

Pinkie Pie’s condition, on the other hand, was... strange. Ignoring the fact that she’d been hanging from the ceiling, her body was completely wrapped in bandages and plaster casts, as if she’d suffered a fall so severe it required full immobilization. Even her face was partially encased in plaster, with only tiny gaps for breathing. Alarmed by the suffocating sounds coming from those narrow openings, Applejack decided to remove the plaster from her mouth to help her breathe.

It was a terrible mistake.

The second her mouth was free, instead of words of relief or gratitude, Pinkie Pie let out a shriek so ear-piercing and prolonged that everyone immediately covered their ears. The entire room vibrated from her screech. Desperate, they tried to calm her down, asking if she was hurt or confused—but to everypony’s surprise, Pinkie Pie responded clearly: she was completely fine and fully aware of the situation. She just hadn’t been able to speak earlier because of the plaster. In fact, she revealed she’d been the second to wake up, right after Applejack turned on the lights—long before Rainbow Dash.

Yet despite being perfectly healthy, Pinkie Pie kept screaming in between her words. When her exasperated friends asked why, her answer was simple:

"I don’t know!"

And so the minutes passed, with no clear explanation and a racket that grew more unbearable by the second.

"For Celestia’s sake! CAN SOMEPONY PLEASE SHUT HER UP ALREADY?!" Rarity shouted from the couch, her face twisted in frustration as her migraine worsened.

"Pinkie, enough! This ain’t funny!" Applejack snapped, her own ears throbbing. Without thinking, she dropped her plaster-covered friend onto the floor with a loud thud.

"Aaaaaaaa! I’m sorry, Applejack... but... but... Ugggggg, I can’t help it! Aaaaaaaaaaaa!" Pinkie’s voice, though tinged with guilt, made it clear she wasn’t joking. She genuinely couldn’t stop screaming—not even when Rainbow Dash tried stuffing an improvised sock into her mouth. It didn’t work; the attempt only made her shriek louder.

Covering their ears, everypony was reaching their limit. Rarity even began glancing desperately at the bookshelf she’d been trapped under earlier, likely considering crawling back under it.

Just as Applejack’s patience ran out, a sudden, commanding voice cut through the chaos.

"MOVE!" Rainbow Dash barked, now wielding a giant wooden mallet between her hooves.

"Where’d you even—? Wait, Rainbow Dash, you’re not thinkin’ of—?" Applejack didn’t get to finish. Before anypony could stop her, Rainbow Dash swung the mallet in a swift, powerful arc—WHAM!—smacking Pinkie Pie square on the head like a carnival game.

A dull thud echoed through the room.

Then... silence.

To everypony’s relief (and subsequent horror), Pinkie’s screams stopped instantly. Rainbow Dash stood triumphantly over the pile of shattered plaster and crumpled bandages where the pink pony now lay. The others exhaled in relief, taking a moment to recover.

But reality soon set in—there wasn’t a single sound from the wreckage. No murmurs. No giggles. Nothing.

Guilt and dread crept over them as they stared at the motionless pile. Just as panic began to rise—

POOF!

Like an inflating balloon, a pink figure burst out of the debris.

"I’m FREEEEEE!" Pinkie Pie cheered, grinning ear to ear, radiating her usual boundless joy... only to faceplant onto the floor seconds later.

"I’m okay..." she mumbled, unmoving, as Fluttershy rushed to check on her.

Rainbow Dash shrugged, looking away.

"Great. Pinkie’s not a screaming mummy anymore, Rarity can breathe, Fluttershy’s invincible, and you’re hatless. Can somepony finally tell me what’s going on here?" she grumbled, tossing the mallet aside and hovering midair.

Applejack raised an eyebrow.

"Oh, thank you for your concern, darling. I’m just fine..." Rarity’s indignant voice came from the couch.

Ignoring the unicorn’s sarcasm, Applejack mulled over Rainbow’s question—and realized, to her annoyance, that she had no answer.

Looking around, her friends wore identical expressions. Nopony had a clue.

A heavy silence fell—until a soft voice broke it.

"Maybe..." Fluttershy spoke up, still cradling Pinkie. "...we should start by figuring out what happened first."

All eyes turned to her—then immediately shifted to Rainbow Dash.

Rainbow Dash froze instantly under the sharp gazes of her friends.

"Hey, hold on a second. I was the last one standing. If we're handing out explanations, you guys owe me yours first," she shot back defensively.

"Oh, darling, so you were the last one standing?" Rarity replied with a hint of sarcasm. "But weren’t you also the first one to leave? Tell us, sweetheart, how did your little date with Vanilla go?"

The pegasus’s feathers bristled immediately.

"Excuse me?! I didn’t ditch you for some fancy tea party like you’re used to, Rarity. I went to fight for all of you!"

"Ah, my mistake, Rainbow. Perhaps I wasn’t clear. Let me rephrase—how did it go?"

Rainbow Dash, still hovering midair, fell silent. Unable to find a retort, she slowly descended, sat down, and hung her head. After what felt like an eternity, she muttered in a defeated tone:

"...I lost."

A cold tension filled the wrecked room. Pinkie Pie, who had been lying on the floor, sat up with a look of concern mirroring Fluttershy’s and wordlessly moved closer to Rainbow. Rarity, with far more elegance, did the same from her spot.

Applejack, who had expected this answer, leaned against her friend in silent support. Rainbow didn’t react. After a heavy pause, she continued:

"I’m not sure what happened... I had him. I’d trapped him and was about to bring him back to you, but then... he did something. After that, everything’s a blur. I think—I think he took control of me. Made me attack you guys. If Twilight hadn’t... I don’t know what else would’ve happened." Her voice was tired, uncharacteristically hollow. The memories of the battle and her defeat weighed on her, a bitter knot tightening in her throat.

Then, in the middle of that painful confession, a single thought struck all of them at once.

"Twilight... where is she?"

Before panic could fully take hold, Pinkie Pie suddenly gasped—

"HOLY PINK ROSES!" she shrieked, eyes wide, making everyone jump. "APPLEJACK! YOU’RE HATLESS!"

Silence.

No one responded to the belated (and wildly off-topic) observation. Least of all Applejack, who took a deep breath, suppressing the sudden urge to scream. It wasn’t the revelation she’d hoped for, but it wasn’t wrong, so she let it slide like a stampede of wild pigs through her orchard.

Pinkie, however, wasn’t done. "...And Twilight! ...She’s not here?" she finished, her cheerful mask cracking to reveal genuine fear.

Had Pinkie’s outburst been intentional? Nopony questioned it in the moment—but if they had, it would’ve made perfect sense. Because the dread that settled over the group was far milder than it could’ve been, thanks to that absurd distraction.

Shaken but not yet frantic, Twilight’s friends exchanged uneasy glances. Soon, they began scouring the room for any sign of their missing leader.

But there was none.

"HOW DID NOPONY NOTICE THIS BEFORE?!" Rainbow Dash yelled, kicking aside a toppled bookshelf in frustration.

"My fault. I thought we were still in her old place. Back then, we’d sleep downstairs while she sometimes stayed in the—" Applejack cut herself off as a bloodcurdling scream tore through the room.

"AAAAAAHHH!"

Everypony whipped around toward the source—Rarity, who was trembling violently, her horrified gaze locked onto the couch she’d been resting on moments ago.

Applejack rushed over. "What’s wrong? Did ya find somethin’?"

"Find something?! LOOK FOR YOURSELF!" Rarity wailed, her voice breaking.

Confused, Applejack stared at the couch. "...It’s a couch."

But to Rarity—whose eyes were trained to spot details nopony else would—that couch was something far worse.

"It’s... PLASTIC!" she sobbed, clutching Fluttershy for support. "The walls are plastic! The lights are plastic! Even the books are plastic! EVERYTHING IS PLAAAASTIC!"

Baffled, the others took a closer look. What had once seemed like a messy but familiar room now felt utterly alien—a place wrapped in an eerie, unnatural aura.

Ignoring the confusion, Pinkie Pie suddenly licked a book.

"Yep. Definitely plastic," she confirmed gravely.

Applejack stomped the floor, frowning. "Weird..."

As murmurs spread, Rainbow Dash shot into the air, cutting through the chatter.

"Okay, so we’ve got a plastic problem. GREAT. Can we maybe focus on the actual issue here? Like, I dunno—FINDING OUR MISSING FRIEND?!"

Then—another scream.

"AAAAAAHHH!"

Pinkie Pie stood frozen, her face pale, staring past Rainbow Dash.

"If this is about my mane looking messy, Pinkie, I swear—" Rainbow growled.

But Pinkie didn’t answer. Her gaze remained fixed.

"Pinkie? What’re ya—?" Applejack turned—and went rigid.

One by one, the others followed her line of sight... and froze.

Several steps behind Rainbow Dash, beyond the couch, a staircase led to what should’ve been the second floor of Twilight’s old home.

But halfway up, shrouded in shadow, somepony stood watching them in silence.

An ordinary earth pony with a pink mane—no armor, no weapons, just a tattered cloak—stared back with cold, unblinking eyes.

Badwhiz Starheart.

Their sworn enemy.

...Was right there.
